A better hex inspection tool

* Easily compare binary files

Todo
* Floating point representation on ruler
* Display modes
  * Canonical hex+ASCII display
  * Decimal mode
  * Character mode
  * Bitmode (from xxd)
* Highlight modes
  * MPEG-TS packet detection
* Fix issue where previous diff gets stuck on the last byte of the file
* Fix issue where diff's of zero bytes are erronously shown as 1 byte.
* Add selection mode
  * CRC32/MD5/SHA1 of selection
  * File format detection (gzip, jffs2 etc)
  * ANSI/Unicode string
* Search mode, improvements to regular expressions suitable for binary files
* Restore find duplicates in binary files
* Add other command line arguments, --help support

Dependancies

glib - 2.0.0 or later (For list, hash and balanced binary tree support)
ncurses - Tested with version 5

Platform

Tested on Ubuntu Linux and MacOS X and RHEL4

Future enhancements

* Allow it to work with files that are bigger than off_t or the maximum mmap size
* Allow the document to be opened before the hashing and diffing is completed, by moving the diff and hash into the background

Ncurses README

Commands with [buffer] prepended can be multiplied by typing in a number.

All modes
 q/Q = Quit
 [buffer] Page Up/Page Down/Arrow keys pager around the file
 [buffer] g/G = Goto
 h/H = Next/Previous Highlight mode
 v/V = Next/Previous visual display mode (note it is linked to pager, this may change to display)

Diff mode
 p/P = Switch focus between the two pagers
 [   = Previous diff
 ]   = Next diff
