HexInspector - A better hex inspection tool

Examine binary files, diff two binary files

To invoke
hi <file1> [<file2>]

Todo
* Floating point representation on ruler
* Display modes
  * Decimal mode (Int16 LE/BE, Int32 LE/BE)
* Highlight modes
  * MPEG-TS packet mode needs improvement
* Add selection mode
  * CRC32/MD5/SHA1 of selection
  * File format detection (gzip, jffs2 etc)
  * ANSI/Unicode string
* Search mode, improvements to regular expressions suitable for binary files
* Restore find duplicates in binary files

* Dependancies *

glib - 2.0.0 or later (For list, hash and balanced binary tree support)
ncurses - Tested with version 5

* Platform *

Tested on Ubuntu Linux and MacOS X and RHEL4

* Future enhancements *

* Allow it to work with files that are bigger than off_t or the maximum mmap size
* Allow the document to be opened before the hashing and diffing is completed, by moving the diff and hash into the background

* Keyboard help *

Buffer

Certain commands can be prefixed with a 'buffer' argument, this takes an int
in either decimal, octal (preceeded by 0),or hex (preceeded by 0x) formats
Escape                       | Clear the buffer
Backspace                    | Remove the last character from buffer

All mode keys
q/Q                          | Quit
?                            | This help (Press to remove)
[buffer] Page Up/Down/Arrows | Move around the file
[buffer] g/G                 | Goto (Negative value in buffer)
                               act as bytes from EOF
                               
Display modes
Note that display modes are not applied to both pagers
=                            | Set the unfocused pager to the same settings
h/H                          | Next/Prev Highlight mode
v/V                          | Next/Prev Display mode (Dec, Hex, Oct etc)
l/L                          | Next/Prev base for address location
[buffer] ,                   | Set byte grouping (default of 4)
[buffer] .                   | Limit/Set number of bytes per line
                               (0 = auto-adjust to the terminal size)

Diff mode only
The following only operate when two files are open
p/P                          | Switch between pagers/files
[buffer] [ or ]              | Previous or next hunk
[buffer] { or }              | Previous or next big diff hunk
