A better hex inspection tool

* Find duplicates in binary files
* Easily compare binary files

Other ideas
* File format detection (gzip, jffs2 etc)
* CRC32/MD5/SHA1 over an selection of data
* Improvements to regular expressions suitable for binary files
* Value representation (big-little endian int, float, double's, ANSI/Unicode string)
* Stuff for MPEG TS files

Dependancies

glib - 2.20.0 or later (For hash and balanced binary tree support)
ncurses - Tested with version 5

Platform

Tested on Ubuntu Linux and MacOS X

Future enhancements

* Allow it to work with files that are bigger than off_t or the maximum mmap size
* Allow the document to be opened before the hashing and diffing is completed, by moving the diff and hash into the background
