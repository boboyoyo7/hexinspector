A better hex inspection tool

* Find duplicates in binary files
* Easily compare binary files

Other ideas
* File format detection (gzip, jffs2 etc)
* CRC32/MD5/SHA1 over an selection of data
* Improvements to regular expressions suitable for binary files
* Value representation (big-little endian int, float, double's, ANSI/Unicode string)
* Stuff for MPEG TS files

WARNING

This code is rather slow and will probably be replaced by C code, but is more a proof of concept.
